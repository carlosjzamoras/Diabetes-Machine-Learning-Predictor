# Diabetes Machine Learning Predictor
Diabetes is defined asa chronic health condition that impacts how the body processes blood sugar. The most accurate way of detecting diabetes is doing a blood test that measures blood glucose levels. While millions of Americans may be diabetic or prediabetic, we want to provide a certain level of assurance before having patients pay for costly blood test.  

## Problem Statement
This study attempts to predict a patient's liklihood of having diabetes based on responses provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We apply known machine learning techniques to predict an individual's diabetes risk and tune our models accordingly. By the end of the study we should have a model that predicts diabetes within a reasonable amount of accuracy and precision. In addition, we will provide the key factors that are the best indicators of diabetes.
